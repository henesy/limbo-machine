1) a client issues http get request to mod_lm_session manager 
   (http[s]://server/styx) to obtain a session (and possibly pass
   some configuration parameters (the server name, port to connect to))
2) session manager checks for max connections + other constraints and either
   proceeds or rejects incomming connection
3) session manager creates a tcp connection to inferno process (server)
4) a client issues an http post (http[s]://server/styx/cafebabe)
   and mounts the system
5) if the connection between client and apache was droped then a different
   http post with the same sessio id (cafebabe) will continue the same
   virtual connection.  *** this can also be caused by a session timeout
6) if the connection between apache and inferno was droped then 
   ther is one attempt to reistablish it *** this can also be caused
   by a session timeout
7) a client retrieves the error code (500 CONN_DROPED) and can start
   from beginning
