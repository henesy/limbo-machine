There are no binaries for the Limbo Machine yet. Please use the  [http://code.google.com/p/limbo-machine/source source] code as described below.

  * Checkout the trunk as described [http://code.google.com/p/limbo-machine/source here] (limbo-machine should be accessible from Inferno)
  * Start the emu
{{{
$ emu
}}}
  * Go to the limbo-machine directory
  * Build everything
{{{
; mk clean build
}}}
  * Run the web server
{{{
; mk start-web
}}}
  Currently it will run a [http://limbo-machine.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/web/sample.b sample] Styx server, which cannot be accessed through HTTP. Please use [ModLM] or uncomment the http.dis machine in web/server.b. [Dispatch] is on the way and it should make things easier.
  * Then open a browser (firefox is the only supported browser as for now) and go to {{{file://<limbo.machine.home>/js/sample.html}}}
  * To stop the system use
{{{
; mk stop
}}}

ModLM build instructions can be found [ModLM here].
