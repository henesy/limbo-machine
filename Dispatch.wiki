#summary Configure & dispatch Styx servers.
#labels Phase-Design

The idea is to have a single entry point for a number of Styx servers (e.g. {{{tcp!somehost!7777}}}, and then dispatch different paths to different Styx server implementations.

A sample configuration might look as follows:
{{{
; cat dispatch.cfg
map sample=/dummyfs
map net=/net

# server definitions
sample=sample.dis
net=redirect.dis path=/net
}}}

The component is in the design/development phase ([http://limbo-machine.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/web/dispatch.b here] is the current code).

Comments are welcome.
