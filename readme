Compile this program:
; limbo sample.b
... copy it to the httpd installation root:
; cp sample.dis /dis/svc/httpd
... run httpd:
; /dis/svc/httpd/httpd
... then open a browser on your native OS and go to:
http://localhost/magic/sample

The first two steps (compile and install) can be automated with:
; mk install
