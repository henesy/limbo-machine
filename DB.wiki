#summary The DB Driver Implementation Ideas.
#labels Featured,Phase-Requirements

We can implement the DB FS:

/db/{tables,query,update}

There is a [http://witme.sourceforge.net/libferris.web/index.html libferris] project which can expose the postgresql DB as the file system. The linux journal article about libferris is available [http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8901 here].

There are two ways to talk to the actual DB:

  * Bridge between the Limbo module and the C DB driver (see limbo -T option)
  * Native Limbo communication with the DB
